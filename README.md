# Unresolved stars in open clusters

### Overview 
There is a huge amount of unresolved stars in open clusters. We research how cluster's mass depends on its presence.

We have done several simulations:
1) considering only binary stars (look `Mass_binary.ipynb` file)
2) considering also triple and quadruple stars (look `Mass_multiple.ipynb` file)


### Input data
1) Luminosity function
2) Isochrone table
3) *q* distribution
4) Isochrone table with a young age
