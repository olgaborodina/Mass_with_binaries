# Unresolved stars in open clusters
There is a huge amount of unresolved stars in open clusters. We research how cluster's mass depends on its presence.

We have done several simulations:
1) considering only binary stars (look `Mass_binary.ipynb` file)
2) considering also triple and quadruple stars (look `Mass_maultiple.ipynb` file)

The repositiry also contains `.py` and `.cpp` files with old versions of code that should be ignored.
